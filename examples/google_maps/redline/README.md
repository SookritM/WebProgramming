# Overview

This is the basic solution for Lab: Closest MBTA Subway Station, Part 2 on Week 4 (https://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/lab-mbta2.html) without the red polyline connecting the stations.  Real-time MBTA Red Line schedule data is coming from Daniel Geary's Heroku app (his lab 12) https://protected-garden-71486.herokuapp.com/redline.json --thank you Daniel.
